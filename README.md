# **Requirements**

**Here are the requirements that needs to be available before starting.**

1. Very good internet connection and device (4/8GB RAM)
2. Python Program available/insalled on machine
3. GitHub (optional)
4. Text Editor (VSCode, I preferred)
5. BscScan API
6. EtherScan API
7. PolygonScan API

# **Getting Started**

All you need is very good internet connection and few python libraries to be installed at the running device.

Follow the below steps one by one if you are starting from scratch. For already experienced people, you know it. Just skip few steps and have a short glace at it.

**Let's go.........**

1. **Install Python from official link** (make sure to use latest version)

```
https://www.python.org/
```

2. After installation of python, clone the **crypto-wallet-bruteforce** using:

```
git clone https://github.com/niyankhadka/crypto-wallet-bruteforce.git
```

`Note: Always look for latest release and use it.`

```
https://github.com/niyankhadka/crypto-wallet-bruteforce/releases
```

3. Go to the path you have clone the repository and hang on!
   There are few steps that need to be done. Don't worry, explore more steps below.

4. Create or login account to the following blockchain explorer and obtain API keys.

a. **BscScan API** [Instruction Here](https://docs.bscscan.com/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics)

```
https://bscscan.com/
```

b. **EtherScan API** [Instruction Here](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics)

```
https://etherscan.io/
```

c. **PolygonScan API** [Instruction Here](https://docs.polygonscan.com/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics)

```
https://polygonscan.com/
```

**Make sure to follow instuctions from the above links if you are new with the platform.**

5. After creating accounts, get back to folder where you were left from the `Step 3``.

```
a. Go to crypto-wallet-bruteforce/python
b. Open config.ini file
c. Paste the copied API keys on respective name there.
```

6. Now it's time to install the python libraries that needed to be installed to run the script. Just hang on, this one is the final setup process. Will try to make setup process easier on updates. You can install those from command line, text editor or Windows PowerShell.

Copy and run following codes one by one:

```
pip install requests
```

```
pip install hdwallet
```

Alright, initial setup process is completed. Now, we are ready to run the script.

# Execution

To run this script on this version, run crypto-wallet-bruteforce from the command line:

```
cd crypto-wallet-bruteforce\python\
```

`Make sure you are on right path. Then type:`

```
python run.py
```

Now, the script will start to run and will display the updates on the screen.

## Updates

- V1.0.0
  `crypto-wallet-bruteforce` now supports detection having Balance and Transaction(s) of bsc, eth and polygon network.

# How to open the discovered wallet?

## Check Successful Wallets

### Wallets having Balance

Navigate to `crypto-wallet-bruteforce\python\hasBalance\` folder. There you can see all the wallets details which has amount on it.

### Wallets having Transaction(s)

Navigate to `crypto-wallet-bruteforce\python\hasTransaction\` folder. There you can see all the wallets details which has transaction(s) on it.

## Limitations

1. API Keys are available on free and pro so, based on it, it depends upon how many scripts you want to run for this bruteforce process.
2. For now, bsc, eth and matic is only supported. For other crypto currencies network, will update later on.
3. It is the initial version of the script so, somewhere there might be missing or issue. If you are interested to contribute, we are open and really appreciated.
